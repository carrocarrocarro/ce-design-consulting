                <h2>Book a free meeting</h2>
                <p>Still, trying to figure it out? Do you have questions or concerns? Book a free meeting where you can have your questions and concerns answered. We are discussing your need for a website and how I can help you. Regardless of the question, I am there for you. The meeting takes place digitally, and I invite you to an online meeting or by phone. For both you and I to get as much as possible from the meeting, I recommend preparing any questions, materials or links you want to share. After the meeting, I will review what we discussed. You will receive a proposal from me on how I can help you and helpful tips. The meeting is 30 minutes long and has no requirements, so you are not bound to buy anything.</p>
