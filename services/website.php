                <h2>Here's how it works - The road to a website</h2>    
                <h3>Inquiry and free meeting</h3>
                <p>After you have sent me an inquiry, you will receive an invitation to a free meeting via phone or web, where we will discuss your wishes. After the meeting, you will receive a summary and a price proposal summarizing your request.</p>
                <h3>Agreement</h3>
                <p>When you and I are satisfied with the order, an agreement is written on the order and terms. The agreement is signed digitally with Bank ID. Remember to read the agreement carefully and leave any comments before signing. In connection with the agreement, the booking fee is also paid.</p>
                <h3>Planning</h3>
                <p>The agreement also states what is included and a timetable. This timetable states what must be done and when things must be completed. This may also apply to certain things that you are responsible for, e.g. text and images for the website. The plan is a tool to ensure that the project is in phase with the possibility of change.</p>
                <h3>Inspiration</h3>
                <p>You get access to my specially designed themes from which you can draw inspiration. Feel free to come with your own wishes and ideas!</p>
                <h3>Website design</h3>
                <p>The design process and the website's development vary between different projects because nothing else is the same. You can read in more detail what is included in the various packages here.</p>
                <h3>Approval of the website</h3>
                <p>When the website is fully designed, a final review takes place. You get access to the website where you can review everything. Once you approve, the site moves on to final delivery. Small changes can be made as needed. If you feel dissatisfied with the design and require major changes, these will be made according to the agreement.</p>
                <h3>Delivery</h3>
                <p>When you have approved the website, final delivery takes place, where you can access any logins. We will agree on when the website will be published. Upon delivery, you will receive the final invoice.</p>

                <h2>Book on time</h2>
                <p>Remember to send a request in time. It may take time until your website is ready for publication depending on the amount of content and functional requirements. Therefore, it is important that you are out in good time. I only accept a limited number of bookings per month with a focus on quality instead of quick solutions. I spend a lot of time with my clients and offer a personal service. Should it be full, you will be placed on a reserve list. When you book, it is important that you pay your booking fee in time to guarantee your place.</p>

                        A website is your digital storefront. Most people in our society own a mobile phone and look up information and companies via the internet. Having a website with relevant content makes it easy for your target group to find you and get in touch with you. You will find more information on the subject in the article Advantages of a website.

                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        Wordpress is today a common tool for the web. As today's technological world is constantly changing and developing, there are many other tools and frameworks for the web. I don't use Wordpress, but modern techniques that not only provide a fast and secure website. These techniques also provide a faster production process and thus a lower cost for you as a customer.
