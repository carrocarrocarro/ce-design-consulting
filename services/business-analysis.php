                <h1>Business analysis</h1>
                <p>Are you currently running a business or do you have an idea that you want to realize? What is your vision for the company and what are your goals for the business? A business analysis helps you to identify the business today, business goals and to set up a strategy to reach the goals. Business goals can relate to profitability, growth, sustainability, sales, marketing, productivity, satisfied customers, company culture and much more. In the business analysis, we evaluate your idea or business. How does the business work today? What services and products do you offer? How do these services and products benefit your customers or potential customers? What is special about your business that sets you apart from your competitors? What does the business offer benefit and is valuable to the target group? What is your vision and goals for the business? The business analysis will give you useful insights about your idea or business and help you set realistic goals. Both long-term and short-term goals. Feel free to combine the business analysis with a target group analysis to get the optimal tools to take your business to the next level.</p>
