                <h1>Web hosting</h1>
                <p>To make your business a little easier, I also offer ongoing hosting and maintenance of your website. In order for your website to be displayed on the web and for people to be able to visit it, a website is required and a hosting service is required. I help you publish the website online and make sure it is on a stable and secure server. Every month, your website is checked and tested to ensure that it remains safe to visit and use. This at a fixed monthly price with no commitment period. This means security for you as an entrepreneur.</p>
