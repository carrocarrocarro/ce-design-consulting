                <h1>Graphic profile</h1>
                <p>How do you want your brand to be perceived and what feeling do you want it to convey? Should it be believable, playful, natural or tough. A clear visual communication action that reflects this feeling and what you want to convey gives a strong brand. Consistent, purposeful communication on all platforms where your customers meet your business makes your brand recognizable and creates credibility. A graphic profile helps give you a tool for how color, typography, images and other graphic elements should be used in your merchandise. Together, these design elements create a whole that reflects what the brand stands for and what the message is conveyed.</p>
                <p>The graphic profile gives you guidelines for the brand's visual communication. A graphic profile is a perfect tool for how you should use colors, fonts, graphic elements and images on the web, in social media, in your marketing and on printed materials. Also for moving image.</p>

            <article class="text">
                <h3>Brand analysis</h3>
                <p>In a brand analysis, you get to tell us about your company or your idea. I get to know your company, what you do, your target group and how what you offer benefits your customers. I will come up with questions and thoughts to understand what exactly you want to convey and communicate. To give you the opportunity to think about it, I will send out a questionnaire in advance.</p>
            </article>
            <article class="text">
                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>Based on the brand analysis, I carry out a research where I both get inspiration and examine what works and suits your brand. If you have, you can also come up with suggestions and ideas. I draw up sketches of how the logo might look.

                <p>In this step, more time is spent on color, shape, feel and font. I present three design proposals for you to look at and think about. We proceed with one of the design proposals, which I then work on. In order for you to be satisfied, we have a close dialogue, where you have the opportunity to make suggestions and input if you want something to change.</p>

                    <p class="faq-answer">
                        A graphic profile is a guide that contains guidelines for the visual expression of the brand. The graphic profile helps to create a common thread through the brand and an expression that is easily recognizable everywhere customers come into contact with the brand. This can be on the web, in social media, on a business card or perhaps a visit to a physical store. You can use the graphic profile as support in your communication and it also helps the rest of the company to stay within the visual guidelines that apply.
