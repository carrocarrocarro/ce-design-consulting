                <h3>Conversation and customer journey</h3>
                <p>The target group analysis includes a conversation where we dive deep into your target group. The goal is to get to know the target group, who they are and where they are. Above all, we want to find out the target group's goals, needs and requirements. Simply what the target group expects from you and your brand. How do your products or services meet your target audience goals. What potential opportunities are there to even better meet your target group goals. We also create a customer journey to identify when and where your target group comes into contact with your business. This helps you understand the customer's experience and needs and where any problems may arise.</p>

                <h3>Meet your target audience</h3>
                <p>After our first conversation, you will receive a task to take home. Your task is to try to meet your target group in a natural context and create insights about how your business is experienced today and how you meet the target group's goals and expectations. For you who have not started your business, this is an excellent opportunity to find out what potential needs there are to meet today and how you can differentiate yourself from your competitors. You will receive tools and support from me during this process.
